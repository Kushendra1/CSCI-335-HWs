Assignment 4

This was definitely the simplest project we have been given so far. Mostly because except for
like 2 or 3 functions, it consisted of editing code that was already there. Because of this,
I found myself over-complicating things. For example, with the GenerateRandomVector and
GenerateSortedVector functions, where I currently have a long wy of implementing them
using for loops and inserting random numbers into each index but I now realize that
I could have just used the push back function for random vector and done the same for
sorted and then use the appropriately named "SORT" function on the random vector. I laugh
at it now because I actually busted my brain over that, but I left it because why not.
Only other problem was formatting the print statements with the correct amount of empty lines
and spaces and I gave my sort file the wrong name, causing gradescope not to recognize it
everytime I submitted - which was annoying.
